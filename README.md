This repository contains the materials for the shiny demo *Scoring the Implicit Association Test has never been easier: DscoreApp* presented at the eRum2020 conference. 

The source code for the [DscoreApp](http://fisppa.psy.unipd.it/DscoreApp/) is available on GitHub ([OttaviaE/DscoreApp](https://github.com/OttaviaE/DscoreApp)). 

## Scoring the Implicit Association Test has never been easier: DscoreApp 

During the past decades, the interest for the implicit investigation of attitudes and preferences has been constantly growing among social scientists, and the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al. 1998) is one of the most common measures used for this aim. The so-called “IAT effect” (i.e., the difference in respondents’ performance between two contrasting categorization tasks) is usually expressed by the *D-score*. Despite the availability of several options for computing the *D-score*, from R packages to SPSS syntaxes, none of them provides either an easy to use interface or a means for immediately visualizing the results. A Shiny Web application (DscoreApp) was developed to provide IAT users with an easy to use and powerful tool for the computation of the *D-score*. DscoreApp allows users to upload their IAT data, decide which specific *D-score* algorithm to compute, and immediately see the results in easy-readable and interactive graphs. At the end of the computation, users can download a data frame containing the computed *D-score* and other information on respondents’ performance, such as the proportion of correct responses or the number of trials exceeding a time threshold. All the graphical representations can be downloaded as well. Besides providing an easy to use and open source tool for computing the *D-score*, DscoreApp allows for grasping an immediate overview of the results and to visually inspect them.
